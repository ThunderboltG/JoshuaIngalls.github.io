## Project description

This job board web scraper was designed as the final project for CSCI 301. I origionally attempted to create the scraper to find jobs off of Indeed, but I was unable to get that working porperly. Instead, i pivoted to the [Python Job Board](https://pythonjobs.github.io/). This scraper uses BeautifulSoup to analyze the HTML structure of the site to find Python jobs and retrieving the details of each job posting

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
